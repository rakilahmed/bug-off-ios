A simple app to track all the bugs of your product. Verified users can add new tickets, edit or delete existing tickets.   

## Steps to run the app

1. Once unzipped, go into the folder and open it in Xcode.

    - Then click on Update To Latest Package Versions
    - Finally, give it a few seconds, and you will be able to run the app with no issues.
